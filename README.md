  ## Descriptions

  This app allows you to improve the productivity of a classroom by giving the user the ability to create task lists that users are then able to send out to students. The app provides a link that, when clicked or access, will populate a page showing only the list desired. Students are able to following along during activities using the tasks given in the list and track their progress by clicking the complete button. The teacher is able to track their progress live as the app updates the progress counter of every task each time the task is marked complete by a student. Students are also given a live chat that allows them to communicate with their teacher and fellow classmates live! Access the app by using this link: https://project-two-ljm.herokuapp.com/
